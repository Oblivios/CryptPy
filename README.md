		CryptPy - Python Message Encrypter/Decrypter.
</h3>

---

## Overview

- CryptPy can encrypt any messages using the python module "Cryptography". If you have the right key, it can also decrypt the messages.
- CryptPy can be useful for text chat applications such as Discord, where you could give your key to your friend, and talk on a server/group but by encrypting your messages which would make it only readable by the people who has the key.

## Installing

You will first need to have Python installed and to make sure that you have added Python to PATH.

Python download link:

`https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.5/python-3.9.5-amd64.exe`

Once you're finished, download CryptPy:

`https://github.com/Oblivios/CryptPy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`

(You can also directly download it from Github).

Extract the folder to somewhere easily accessible.

You should have a folder containing the following files:

Once you have a commant prompt open to the correct path, you should type the following command:

`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run CryptPy, open your CMD the same way as above and type "Crypt.py", then press enter:

## Usage

If you wanna generate a key, type "Y", it'll generate you a key that you will have to give to your friend.

Then your friend would have to type "N" and paste the key.

From here, you can choose if you want to encrypt the message (by typing "E") or decrypt a message (by typing "D").

To encrypt, you type "E" and then you write what you want to encrypt, somewhere (for example on a Discord chat) and then, you can Ctrl+A your message or highlight it with your mouse like this:

Then, when your message is highlighted, you have to press Ctrl+C two times (to copy the message), it should do something like that:

You can now send the encrypted message on the chat !

Now, to decrypt a message, you must have the right key, otherwise it won't work.

You simply have to type "D" and paste the encrypted message:

Now that you know how to use CryptPy, have fun and keep your messages secret !
