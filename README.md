		CryptPy - Python Message Encrypter/Decrypter.
</h3>

---

## Overview

- CryptPy can encrypt any messages using the python module "Cryptography". If you have the right key, it can also decrypt the messages.
- CryptPy can be useful for text chat applications such as Discord, where you could give your key to your friend, and talk on a server/group but by encrypting your messages which would make it only readable by the people who has the key.

## Installing

You will first need to have Python installed and to make sure that you have added Python to PATH.

## Usage

After an update, CryptPy nearly works alone. 

All you have to do is highlight your message with Ctrl+A or with your mouse like this:

Then, when your message is highlighted, you have to press Ctrl+C two times (to copy the message), it should do something like that:
